summary: Painting the topside of Yellow 44.
---

Yak fighters prior to 1943 were usually painted with a green and black camouflage pattern. The colours were standardized but due to various reasons factories were not always able to get their hands on the right paint. The Great Patriotic War wasn't about to stop because of the wrong paint colour so Yaks often went into battle with whatever shade happened to be on hand; even if it was found in a barn for painting tractors. Yellow 44 is covered in a lighter shade of green than the standard would be. I also used a dark brown instead of flat black for the contrasting pattern since I found that black was too dark and crushed the highlights in the green. 

Start by salting salt the metal panel lines and areas of high wear on the flight surfaces...

... follow with the usual three layer blend. Base-layer:

Highlight layer:

Blend layer:

Mask out the areas that will remain green. Rolls of bluetac are used to make soft fades between the colors. Masking tape sticks like crazy to bluetac so you can use it to fill in the bulk areas without having to use a ton of bluetac. The brown parts of the camouflage are given the same three layer blend.

Just like on the bottom side of the aircraft, the salt needs to be thoroughly cleaned off, otherwise it will fog the clear coat. Scrub it off with a soft tooth brush and warm water. The paint finish was still to crisp so I worn it down even more with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. Magic Erasers are micro-abrasive when damp so you can use them as super fine sandpaper that conforms to the surface you're sanding. High areas on the fuselage, the parts of the wings that get walked all over, the engine cowlings and gun ports all get a good scrubbing. This removes the blend layer, revealing the lightened highlight layer leaving a faded look and accentuates the chips.
