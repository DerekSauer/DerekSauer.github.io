Spent most of the day working on the cockpit. Accurate Miniatures really went all out on this cockpit. Its got almost as many pieces as the rest of the kit and some clever assembly features to get all that detail into such a small space. Certain features have more effort than is needed invested in them though. The rudder pedals, cannon cocking lever and cannon shell return will never been seen unless we find a 1/48 scale person to sit in the cockpit. Most of the cockpit won't be visible period since the Yak's office is a really cramped space anyhow. Yak pilots didn't ride in their plane so much as wear it. All the levers, knobs and switches are pretty much where they're supposed be; at least according to my likely inaccurate reference of flying Yaks in flight sims since I was 12 years old. I'm very happy with the Eduard Photo-Etch on the control panel and seat belts. Really helps to give them some extra pop and they're going to be the most visible parts once the cockpit is stuff inside the fuselage. 

The Witch 3 is being released today, so RIP any more work on this for the next few weeks.

Still not happy with my photography, it really smashed the colors and contrast. The instrument panel looks fantastic when seen with real eyeballs.
