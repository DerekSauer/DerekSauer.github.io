The [Yakovlev Yak-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-1) is my favorite Soviet fighter plane of the Second World War so I was pretty happy when I found one of Accurate Miniature's Yak-1 kits for next to nothing on E-Bay. On top of that the aircraft depicted in this kit is Yellow 44 which was flown by [Lydia Litvyak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Litvyak), who still holds the record for aerial victories by female fighter pilot. Five of her twelve kills were accomplished in Yellow 44.

When I bought this kit I wasn't aware of Accurate Miniature's reputation for making highly detailed, over-engineered kits so I was pretty surprised to see how how complex the cockpit assembly would be; its got just about every knob and handle and widget you normally find in a Yak-1, except for the radio stack which I'll make up for with Photo-Etch. I was also surprised by the way they handled the fuselage assembly. Instead of the usual left and right fuselage halves, it comes in three pieces and the joint is right above the fabric sides where its going to be 'interesting' to eliminate the seam without damaging the fabric ribbing.

The plastic looks pretty good though there's some areas where you can see bits of the molds that have removable inserts so they can use most of the same mold to make different variants of the aircraft. This is particularly visible in the wingtips. There's very little flash and the mold lines are faint for the most part. The recessed panels lines are a little deep which is just fine since I plan to heavily weather panel edges along the metal parts of the Yak.

And then there's this little bit. A copyright notice molded on the outside of the wing. Internet graybeards tells me that this is a common thing to find on American made kits. Supposedly makes it harder to produce counterfeights or some such though I don't know what is stopping a counterfeighter from just filing it off as I plan to do.

Hannant's was having a clearance sale on some of their old after market bits and an Eduard photo-etch kit for this model was in the pile; yippy! They somehow managed to mail it to Canada from the UK in two days for next to no postage cost. Guess I'm going to be doing more business with them in the future. In reality I'm not going to use most of the photo-etch. The majority of it is cockpit bits and the detail included with the kit is better than the brass. I will be using the seatbelts, radiator grills, radio box and some cockpit placards. I'll try using the leftover brass sprue to built shackles for the radio antenna as there aren't any attachment points on the model itself for some reason and probably try improving the gunsight since the included one is a bit sparse; there's no backup gunsight doodads.

This is my first time using Photo-Etch so we'll see how it goes overall. I played around with it a bit tonight and its rather fragile fiddly stuff. On the plus side I now have the cutest little radio.

Starting the cockpit tomorrow.
