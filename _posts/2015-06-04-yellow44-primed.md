The patched up air intake that gave me trouble last week ended up working out okay; everything works out okay with enough Milliput. Its not perfectly smooth but that's alright since presumably that part of the air plane would have gotten pretty banged up anyway operating out of crappy dirt airfields. Masking the canopy was a piece of cake; the clear bits have rather deep framing that made it easy to trim out the important parts. 

Here she is primed and ready for the fun part. Before priming I lightly ran some 1000 grit wet sand paper over all the large surfaces. Seems to help significantly with primer adhesion. After that all surfaces were cleaned with alcohol and a microfibre cloth.

You can barely tell that horrid intake was a terrible decision on AMT's part. The large seam on the bottom of the tail will remain since eliminating it would probably cause more problems than it would solve. That area is full of finely molded fabric detail that will be obliterated by sanding. It probably won't be to noticeable once the blue under side painting is done... probably.
