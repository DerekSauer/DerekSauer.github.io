summary: Fixing the gaps in Yellow 44's joints.

Major assemblies are completed but there's a lot of gaps to fill. My favorite way to handle gaps is with tape damns and liquid putty. Use strips of tape to protect the areas surrounding the gap and stop the putty from going where you don't want it go.

Splatter putty all over the gap making sure to inhale as many fumes as possible.

Let it dry completely and peel off the tape.

Use Q-Tips and Acetone to disolve away the bulk of the putty, leaving just what is needed to fill the gap. Sand the hell out it and you're good to go.
