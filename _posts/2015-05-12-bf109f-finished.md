title: 1/48 Bf-109F - Finished

This is the first scale model I've built in over 12 years. I used to build models relatively often when I was younger but a career change left me with little time to enjoy hobbies. That's no longer the case and I greatly enjoyed working on a kit for the first time in years. This one doesn't have a detailed build log since I hadn't decided during construction if I wanted to keep a build... blog, heh.

I won't bother boring anyone with the history and technical details of the Bf-109; anyone with the slightest interest in World War II era aircraft is already familiar with this aircraft. The kit is the [1/48 BF109F-4 Super Experten](http://www.hasegawausa.com/product-pages/hsgs7379.html). This kit is an entire generation ahead of anything I built a decade ago. Recessed panel lines are rather novel and having parts that actually fit well is a nice change... when they fit. The engine cowls were either warped or to short and required a considerable amount of filling. They're also the only part of the model that actually needed any filling so no complaints really. I know that Hasegawa's concept with their Bf-109 models is to have one master mold for the overall shape of the aircraft and include extra bits in the box to make the specific variant marketed. Its a good idea that saves on their production costs, but it really shows in the kit itself. There are many parts that are small and fiddly needing to be cemented on when they could have been easily moulded in instead. The kit is still miles ahead of the Revell kits that were my mainstays "back in the day".

This is kit is also the first time I've ever used an airbrush and a vast portion of the build time was simply learning how to handle that beast. Properly thinning paint is a real challenge, especially when different colours have different consistencies even within the same paint brand. Much of my attempts to add depth by shading and highlighting were also ruined by applying to many coats that were put down to heavy. Clear coats were put down to heavy. Even brush work was done to heavily. There's a whole list of my own lessons below but I can sum up painting as:

> *When you think you need one more pass...* _STOP!_

While the entire build was a huge learning experience and involved many frustrations I enjoyed the process immensely and the bird doesn't look to bad either.

### Lessons Learned
* Let everything dry and cure before moving on. The dirt wash is way to dirty because the clear coat was not sufficiently dry before I applied the wash so it mixed in and wouldn't wipe away.
* Thinning paint is hard. Practice before shooting it on a model. There's many coats of paint on the fuselage from me over or under thinning paint and getting either splattering or pooling. 
* Epoxy putty (Milliput Fine in this case) is awesome and kicks the crap out of Tamiya Putty for filling large gaps. The engine cowls outright didn't fit and had huge gaps in them. Tamiya just kept sinking into the gaps, Milliput didn't. Takes a lot longer to dry but see the first point. Drying time is good.
* Keep tiny parts on the sprue while working on them. That model has no control stick, Revi sight or pitot tube because they decided they wanted to be free when grasping them with tweezers. They live somewhere in my home now... somewhere.
* Keep tiny parts off the model until you really, really need them. I broke the radio antenna so many times its three millimetres shorter than it should be. I was also forced to use much thicker stretched sprue when wiring the antenna because anything smaller wouldn't support its own weight and pulled the fragile antenna off. I'm going to use "invisible" repair thread next time. Its super thin and strong, way thinner than fishing line. I also want to add attachment hardware for the antenna because it looks odd just floating like that.
* Decant anything in a spray can and shoot it with your airbrush. I applied the matt coat straight from the rattle can and it went on way to heavy. This caused uneven drying times and made the finish crack. Repaired with some more gloss varnish and a thin coat of matt but you can still see it on large surfaces.
* Don't use Glad Press'n Seal to mask your canopies. If you leave it on for more than a day it leaves behind a residue that is hell to remove. There's also damage to the canopy where cement crazed it from repairing the frequently broken antenna.
* Get a real camera. My phone's camera is good for a phone camera but the focal length is so short you can't photograph a model without something being blurry and the aperture is so small you need to blast whatever you're shooting in light.
