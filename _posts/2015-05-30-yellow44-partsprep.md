summary: Preparing Yellow 44's various parts for painting and assembly.

It has been way to humid for the past week to do any painting and I'm getting sick of not getting any work done on Yellow 44. So if we can't paint, we can at least prepare the rest of the parts for painting once the air stops being so thick you can drink it. Everything is cleaned up and sanded, a veritable forest of parts.

One oddity is this spar on the lower wing. It makes up the rear portion of the wheel wells as well as establishing the dihedral for the wings and aligns the cockpit tub when you install it. It was a complete pain in the butt to install and *The Internet* tells me that most folks who build this model tend to have trouble with it. It has no support structure around it and only has a small centering pin in the middle to show you where it is supposed to go. Its on you to make sure its straight and solidly cemented to the lower wing. That takes clamps and clamps love to press to hard and snap your very important piece. This whole installation was done with held breath.

See how it has nothing holding it up at all aside from the plastic cement. In the end it will be completely boxed in by other components, but it was tricky getting it in place with no locator pins or side structure to hold on to.

Weather forcast looks nice and dry tomorrow so I will hopefully be able to shoot some paint.
