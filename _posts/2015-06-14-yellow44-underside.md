Salt! Its not just for adding flavour and hypertension to things. Its also an excellent medium for creating small scale chipped paint. Not only does it act like a mask with random jagged edges, it also discolours the surrounding paint slightly making it look distressed. Its all the chipping effects you want in one tasty package.

Applying it is easy, just add water. Mix a few drops of dish detergent into in a small container of *cold* water. The detergent acts like a surfactant, reducing surface tension and allowing the water to stay where you put it rather than pulling itself into small drops. Use a paint brush to apply water anywhere you want chipping to occur and sprinkle on some salt. Table salt is fine. Use kosher salt or course sea salt for larger chips. Mix different grades of salt for greater variation. Once the water has evaporated away give your model a flick with your finger (assuming its strong enough to take that) and all the loose salt will fall off. You can use a *completely dry* brush to remove any excess salt to better form the chipping areas you want.

Make sure the water is completely dry before proceeding. If it is still damp the dissolved salt will mix with your paint and prevent it from fully curing, causing it to flake off rather than adhere. That might actually be a desired effect in some cases. Begin the three-layer blend. Base layer of sky blue.

Cut the sky blue with 50% white and spray inside the panel lines and the raised fabric areas to highlight them. Its supposed to look like crap at this point.

Lightly spray with heavily thinned sky blue to blend the variation together. This is just a fine filter or glaze. I used about a one to four mix of Vallejo Model Air sky blue and future and kept the airbrush further away than normal while moving quickly. Repeat this until the two layers are blended to taste.

Once the paint is *completely dry* use your finger to rub off the salt. Adding salt to water adheres it to the model surface rather well but also forms a small puddle of dissolved salt that has to be removed before you clear coat the paint. The salt will redissolve in the varnish and cause it to frost. Just use some warm water and paper towel to lightly wipe off the excess salt. Rub to hard and you'll strip off some paint, which might actually look pretty good in some cases.

All done. The landing gear doors were given the same treatment. Shoot the finish with a few thin layers of clear coat and its ready to be masked for the top side's paint job.
