summary: Painting Yellow 44's undercoat.
---

Tactical fighters like the Yak-1 were usually based out of small primitive dirt or grass airfields in the middle of nowhere. As such they tended to get completely beat to hell by the dust and gravel and that's the look I wanted for Yellow 44. A plane that not only operated from cruddy airfields but also got into many fights with the Luftwaffe. Her weapons would have smeared carbon soot all over the nose, oil would be everywhere and the odd patched bullet or Flak hole could be found. 

To make Yellow 44 look like a well worn Yak the paint job is going to have to be chipped and scraped and stained. Whatever was under the paint will have to be visible. On parts of the plane that got hot or needed reinforcement, that would be aluminium. The rest of the aircraft was skinned in resin impregnated plywood and fabric which was liberally smeared in a nitro-cellulous based putty that had a tan to yellowish colour depending on where the factory was able to source the putty. 

So the first step in painting Yellow 44 is preparing the surfaces under its regular paint job. Metal bits were masked around and sprayed with [Alclad's Polished Aluminium](http://alclad2.com/finishes/high-shine/alc-105-polished-aluminium/), then the metal parts were masked over and the rest of the plane sprayed with Vallejo's Tan. A little lightened and darkened tan was sprayed along the direction of air travel to give a little tonal variation. Not sure if it will have any effect on the darkish green top coat that will go on next, we'll see.

Alclad is pretty amazing stuff. Its the best metalizer paint I've ever used, even if it is cancer in a bottle. You're supposed to apply it rather lightly to the highest gloss black undercoat that you can manage. They make a glossy black primer that is perfect for it and it will give you a nearly reflective aluminium look if you use it. I didn't want that here since aluminium with its paint scraped off would oxidize leaving a duller look. I used a single light coat of Vallejo's Gloss Black on top of the flat black primer. It kills the shine just enough. The clear coat protective finish after all the painting is done will dull it even more.
