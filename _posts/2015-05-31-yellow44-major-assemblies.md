I figured that since most of the parts were cleaned up and prepared for painting, cementing the major assemblies would be quick and painless and after a little light sanding I would get to the fun part, painting, tomorrow. That was a terrible assumption to make. My earlier admiration at the clever engineering in this kit was misplaced as all the little clever bits have just made the assembly of this aircraft harder than they had to be. I can appreciate that Accurate Miniatures developed a very detailed, if part heavy, cockpit but they probably should have gone with more traditional methods for the rest of the kit.

That little doohicky is an air intake and everyone knows that there is no way its going to fit in that slot anywhere near as well as its designers hoped it would. They designed it like this so that they could produce different Yak variants using the same molds since the air intake shape is one of the few external difference among Yak variants.

Milliput is going to be earning it pay the next time I'm working on this model. Good thing Accurate Miniatures didn't put any rivet holes on that piece because they would be getting obliterated when I fix the gap.

The underside is bad but the patch job won't be to horrible. Just mush some putty into the gaps and let it cure. Then sand it flat and scribe new panels lines and rivet holes. Shouldn't take more than an hour. That gap on the leading edge is a bigger problem. If the top and bottom parts lined up it would be easy, but they don't. The lower half is inset to the rear by about a millimetre. It is going to need a good bit of sculpting to patch up and look smooth. Needless to say the clever three piece fuselage didn't fit together all the well either and its going to be difficult to get it nice and flat without destroying the panel lines and rivets.

All the griping aside, she's starting to look like a Yak-1; with the big wings and short tail that lets it turn so tight it can fly right up its own ass. Next time we see her she'll be covered in putty, which is actually rather accurate given Soviet aircraft production techniques in 1942.
