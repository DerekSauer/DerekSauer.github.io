summary: Applying Yellow 44's decals.
---

Applying decals is the part of a project that I don't really look forward to. They're finicky and fragile and sort of annoying to work with. Some warm water with a little dish soap in it helps a bit as well as using a decent decal solvent but you're still sitting on pins and needles while applying them. Thankfully the VVS wasn't big on putting stencils all over their planes so there aren't many to do. 

Making the decals fit in with the rest of Yellow 44's beat up paint job took a little extra work. I thought at first I would just run a magic eraser over them like I did with the paint but that's not going to work. Magic erasers need to be wet to be abrasive and water will just make the decals lift off. A small strip of 500 grit sand paper, a light touch and ample butt clenching was needed. Worked out pretty well in the end.

Next up will be a dirt wash to make things properly nasty looking and some pigment powered to add that "horrible airfield in the middle of nowhere" look.
