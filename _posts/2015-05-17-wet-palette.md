title: Wet Palette - Up your Paint Game!
layout: post
---

Sick of your water base paint going dry in that crappy little plastic dish you've been using since forever? Working with Vallejo Model Color that immediately dries out if you stare at it too hard? You need a wet palette. Easy to make and probably cheaper than that shitty plastic dish with the color pots that Omer Dessers sells at a 500% markup.

### Container of some Sort
Doesn't matter what you use as long as its water proof and has raised sides so your water stays where you put it instead of all over the place. Water going where we don't want it is why we're here in the first place.

### Sponge
You can use any absorbant material you want but artificial sponge with antimicrobial additive is the way to go if you don't want your palette turning into a germ colony in a few days. Just jam it in there, chop it up to fit. Then soak it. Get it completely sopping wet. A few drop of bleach is also helpful if you really want to deprive our single celled friends of a new home. It won't effect your paint.

### Parchment Paper
Find it at the grocery store. Cooking with parchment paper is a fad for hispters now so you can find all sorts of colors and shapes. Get the cheapest they have you're not going to be cooking with it... unless you do, you big yuppy. Don't use wax paper, parchment paper. The smallest roll will last you forever.

### Chill Out
Cut up a sheet and lay it out on the sponge. It will curl up because its cold and wet, like when you wake up in a ditch after an all night bender. It will eventually realize that this is its new life now and relax as the water soaks in.

### Paint with It
Its a palette now. I trust I don't need to tell you how to use a palette.

### Immortal Paint
Your paint will dry out a lot slower now. If you use to much at once it will get a little skin on it like that gross skin you get on top of cream of mushroom soup but that's your fault for using to much paint. Need to stop and post in the Witcher 3 thread for a few hours? Slap the cover on and throw it in the fridge. Your paint is undead.
